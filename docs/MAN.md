## Examples 
Logging network traffic in Apache like format:

    justniffer -i eth0 

Tracing tcpdump dump in Apache like format:

    justniffer -f file.cap 

Tracing TCP streams from the network:

    justniffer -i eth0 -r 

Logging network traffic in Apache like format appending response times:
    
    justniffer -i eth0 -a " %response.time" 

Logging network traffic in a customized format:

    justniffer -i eth0 -l "%source.ip%tab%dest.ip%tab%request.header.host%tab%response.time" 

## DESCRIPTION

justniffer captures reassembles and reorders TCP packets, performs IP packet defragmentation and displays the tcp flow in the standard output.
It is useful for logging network traffic in a 'standard' (web server like) or in a customized way.
It can log network services performances (e.g. web server response time , application server keep alive behaviour, etc.) .
Output format can be customized using the log format option -l (see FORMAT KEYWORDS). 
Most of them can be used for retrieving HTTP protocol informations. See EXAMPLES
 

## TRACKING PERFORMANCES
The main feature of justniffer is to analize network traffic to monitor performances. The performances related keywords are:
- %connection.time
- %idle.time.0
- %request.time
- %response.time
    - %response.time.begin
    - %response.time.end
- %idle.time.1

## OPTIONS

**-i** or **--interface=<interface>** interface to listen on (e.g. eth0, en1, etc.)
Example: justniffer -i eth0
**-f** or **--filecap=<file>**tcpdump file to read from (for offline network traffic processing). It must be a pcap file (produced by network capture programs such as tcpdump or wireshark) WARNING: justniffer needs a complete dump, usually, sniffers collect just the few first (96) bytes per packet. (when using tcpdump you must specify "-s 0" option. Example:

     tcpdump -i eth0 -s 0 -w /tmp/file.cap)

Example: justniffer -f /tmp/file.cap
    -F or --force-read-pcap
    Force the reading of a pcap file also if captured with truncated packets (for example when using tcpdump without the "-s 0" option)
    -p or --packet-filter=<filter>
    packet filter (pcap filter syntax) (see pcap-filter(7))

Examples:

sniffing proxy traffic

    justniffer -i eth0 -p "tcp port 8080"


sniffing raw telnet traffic

        justniffer -i eth0 -r -p "tcp port 23"


sniffing raw pop3 traffic

        justniffer -i eth0 -r -p "tcp port 110"


sniffing  traffic from/to a specific host

        justniffer -i eth0 -r -p "host 10.10.10.2"


sniffing  HTTP traffic from/to a specific host and port

        justniffer -i eth0 -r -p "host 10.10.10.2 and tcp port 80"


**-l** or **--log-format=<format>** log format. You can specify the output string format containing reserved keyword that will be replaced with the proper value (see FORMAT KEYWORDS). If missing, the CLF (Common Log Format, used by almost all web servers) is used as default.

Example:

     justniffer -i eth0 -l "\"%request.line\"%tab%response.time"

        "POST /v2/rss/alerts?src=ffbmext2.1.034 HTTP/1.1" 0.139011
        "POST /v2/rss/network/oreste.notelli?src=ffbmext2.1.034 HTTP/1.1" 0.623382
        "GET /man_page_howto.html HTTP/1.1"       0.024437
        "GET /ig?hl=en HTTP/1.1"  0.764945
        "GET /?hl=en&tab=wv HTTP/1.1"   0.242342
        "GET /s/-yCdCsgUnsI/css/homepage_c.css HTTP/1.1"        0.071942
        "GET /vi/YUvWcegtqik/default.jpg HTTP/1.1"      0.821472

**-r** or **--raw**
show raw stream. it is a shortcut for -l %request%response

Example: justniffer -i eth0 -r

****-m or \--capture-in-the-middle****

Captures and reconstructs TCP streams in the middle (even without
    the initial connection).\
    **WARNING: it may yield unexpected results.**

**-s** or **--max-tcp-streams** max concurrent TCP stream. (default= 65536) excess will be discarded
**-d** or **--max-fragmented-ip** max concurrent fragmented IP. (default= 65536) excess will be discarded
**-u** or **--unprintable** encode as dots (.) unprintable characters ( for more control on character you should use pipelining to cat -v.

Example:

    justniffer -i eth0 -l "%request%newline%response"| cat -v
    justniffer -i eth0 -ru
    -x or --hex-encode
    encode unprintable characters in [<char hex code>] format
    Example:

    justniffer -i eth0 -rx


**-n** or **--not-found <not found string>** Not found string. It is used to replace a specified keyword when it cannot be valued because it is not found. All request.header.* and response.header.* keywords can override the "not found string" passing it as parameter. For example:

**%request.header.host()** will be replaced by the Host header value, or an empty string if Host header not found

**%request.header.host(UNKNOWN)** will be replaced by the Host header 
value, or the UNKNOWN string if Host header not found

**%request.header.host** will be replaced by the Host header value, or , if Host header not found, with  the string specified by the -n option 


Examples:

    justniffer -i eth0 -l "%request.header.connection" -n N/A  

will produce such logs:

        N/A
        N/A
        keep-alive
        close

Note: each keyword can override the "not found string" value:

    justniffer -i eth0 -l "%request.header.connection(None) %request.header.connection(-) %request.header.connection() %request.header.connection" -n N/A  

will produce such logs:

        None -  N/A
        None -  N/A
        keep-alive keep-alive keep-alive keep-alive
        close close close close

**-e** or **--execute**<external program> call the specified external program/shell script pipelining the standard output for each request/response phase You can write shell script for handling, for example, HTTP traffic
Example:

    justniffer -i eth0 -l "%request%newline%response" -e "tail -2 "

**-U** or **--user=<user>** User to impersonate when executing the program specified with the -e option, used to avoid to security exploits when running justniffer with root privileges
Example:

    justniffer -i eth0 -l "%request%newline%response" -e "grep password >> /tmp/passwords.txt"  -U guest
**-c** or **--config=<config file>** configuration file. You can specify options in a configuration file (command line options override file configuration options) using the following format specifications:
    <option> = <value>

configuration file example:

    log-format = "%request.url %request.header.host %response.code %%response.time"
    packet-filter = "tcp port 80 or tcp port 8080 or tcp port 3526"
